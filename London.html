        London is the capital of the United Kingdom. <br>
        It is situated in south-eastern England at <br>
        the head of the River Thames estuary. <br>
        Settled by the Romans as an important <br>
        shipping point for crops and minerals, <br>
        it gradually developed into the wealthy capital <br>
        of a thriving industrial and agricultural nation. <br>
        London straddles the River Thames, <br>
        80 km upriver from its mouth at the Nore, <br>
        where the English Channel joins the North Sea. <br>
        Most of London, including its central districts <br>
        and the majority of its famous landmarks, <br>
        lies to the north of the river. <br>
        The original settlement that gave London its name <br>
        was the Roman fort of Londinium, <br>
        founded in the first century AD. <br>
        The City of London is on the site where this stood, <br>
        and the description of the Roman town as "<br>
        a busy emporium for trade and traders" <br>
        by the Roman historian Tacitus seems equally apt today. <br>
        St Paul's Cathedral stands on the western edge of the City, <br>
        and the Tower of London, <br>
        the Norman fortress built by William the Conqueror <br>
        to defend his new lands late in the 11th century <br>
        (listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site), <br>
        lies to the south-east.<br>
        It is the current repository of the Crown Jewels.<br>
        Spanning the river to Southwark (west of Tower Bridge) <br>
        is London Bridge, a modern replacement <br>
        of the only bridge over the Thames in London until the 18th century.<br>
        To the east and north-east of the City <br>
        are the predominantly working-class districts of the East End, <br>
        home to successive waves of immigrants from Ireland,<br>
        continental Europe, and the former British Empire.<br>
        Lively and industrious, the East End continues to have many thriving small businesses.<br>
        The area known as the Docklands comprises (on the north bank of the Thames) <br>
        the districts of Wapping and Poplar,<br>
        the Isle of Dogs, the Royal Docks,
        and (to the south of the Thames) Surrey Docks.<br>
        Docklands is the site of a massive inner city regeneration project.<br>
        West of the City lie the ancient Inns of Court <br>
        (Lincoln's Inn, Middle Temple, Inner Temple, and Gray's Inn),<br>
        the legal district occupied by barristers and firms of solicitors; <br>
        and Fleet Street, once the home of Britain's national press <br>
        (which has now relocated to other parts of the capital).<br>
        Further to the north-west is Bloomsbury, <br>
        the haunt in the 1920s of a renowned group of literary intellectuals (the Bloomsbury Group), <br>
        thanks to its proximity to London University and the British Museum.
